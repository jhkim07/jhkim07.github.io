# RoboRacer (F1TENTH)

This course introduces the fundamentals of autonomous driving using the **F1TENTH RoboRacer platform**.  
Students learn perception, planning, and control algorithms through hands-on labs and real-world racing challenges.

## Course Overview
- ROS2-based autonomous system development  
- LiDAR processing and safety (AEB, Gap Follow)  
- SLAM, localization, and mapping  
- Reinforcement-learning-based look-ahead controller  
- F1TENTH Race: time attack & obstacle racing  

## Course Materials
- 📘 Lecture slides and reading notes  
- 🧪 Labs: Teleop, AEB, GapFollow, Pure Pursuit, SLAM, RL-based control  
- 🛞 Race evaluation sheets and scoring rules  
- 📦 GitHub resources (simulation & ROS2 packages)
