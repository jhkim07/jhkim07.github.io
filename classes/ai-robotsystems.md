# RoboRacer (AI Robot)

RoboRacer is a project-based course that uses an autonomous racing  
platform (e.g., **F1TENTH**) to teach **perception**, **planning**, and  
**control** with a strong focus on **safety**.

## Course Highlights
- ROS2-based software stack for autonomous racing  
- LiDAR perception, gap-following, and AEB implementation  
- Reinforcement learning for adaptive control  
- Team-based racing events and performance evaluation  

## Typical Topics
- Sensor models and time-to-collision  
- Pure pursuit and look-ahead control  
- Simulation vs. real-world transfer  
- Safety monitors and fallback strategies
