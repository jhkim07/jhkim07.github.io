    <h2>Formal Verification of CPS</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
      This page covers projects on <strong>formal verification</strong> of
      <strong>cyber-physical systems (CPS)</strong>, including timing,
      safety, and correctness guarantees.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Themes</h3>
    <ul class="section-text">
      <li>Timed automata and model checking for CPS</li>
      <li>Tool chains that connect real code to formal models</li>
      <li>Verification-guided design of controllers and schedulers</li>
      <li>Bridging the gap between theory and real systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Selected Projects</h3>
    <ul class="section-text">
      <li>
        <strong>Timed Automata to Go (TADA):</strong> A pipeline for
        deriving timed automata models from system designs and code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Verification of Medical Devices:</strong> Applying formal
        methods to safety-critical monitoring and control algorithms.
      </li>
